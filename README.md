# doing-crypto

This is a repo where I spent some of my rare spare time hours to keep my computer skills in shape. Therefore I'll try to re-implement a few of the most common crypto algorithms in python.

_Warning:_ This is just for fun! I DO NOT encourage anybody to use my implementations anywhere. They are probably full of bugs, flaws and use insecure random numbers! Use industry standard implementations. I do in production environments as well.
